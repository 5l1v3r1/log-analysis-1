|Week |Jussi | Eino | Saku | Tasks |
|-----|------|-----|------|------|
|wk 34|12|12|12|Formed the group, decided subject|
|wk 35|6|10|10|Worked on project plan, tested ELK-stack|
|wk 36|18|18|18|Finalized project plan, got server running, looked into alternative open source modules, migrated all documentation to Github|
|wk 37|14|14|14|Removed Logstash and Beats. Started troubleshooting Rsyslog, presented projectplan. Troubleshot Rsyslog, but broke Elasticsearch. Reinstalled server and components seem to work. Still unable to pass data from Rsyslog to Elasticsearch properly|
|wk 38|17|17|17|Found out that Rsyslog has generated over 200Gb of data during the weekend, let the troubleshooting be joined. We couldn't get Rsyslog-elasticsearch-kibana setup to work properly. We started our individual setups with different components. Jussi took the original Elk-stack, Eino started working with Graylog and Saku took Rsyslog-logstash-Elasticsearch-Kibana|
|wk 39|8|5|8|Monday was a sickday all around, not much got done. On wednesday we had a meeting with Tero and continued our work. Jussi passed data to Kibana with and without Logstash! Eino got Graylog working to some degree and Saku got everything running, but Logstash didn't pass data to Elasticsearch. Trying to capture the proper JSON format used by Beats with Wireshark. We passed data from a client to Jussi's Kibana server with metricbeat.|
|wk 40|16|16|16|Continued our work on previous tasks on monday. On wednesday, Jussi passed data from rsyslog to Elasticsearch and Kibana. Saku and Eino continued working on their own builds. On friday, Saku got his stack with logstash working. Eino started working on setting up TSL. Jussi is removing containers from his build and refining the overall structure.|
|wk 41|13|15|15|We have working TLS-connection though anyone can start the secured connection, so need to set up ip-whitelist or make a system with certs and keys. Encrypted messaging with unsecure (public) keys and certs done, next step generating custom and secure. **RELK-stack build works! Data flow from logging client to Kibana working.**|
|wk 42||||Week off, worked on other projects|
|wk 43||9|8|Saku worked on setting up authentication for ElasticSearch, Eino continued working on his project|
|wk 44|9|16|16|Saku got his elasticsearch authentication plugin [readonlyREST](https://github.com/jisosomppi/log-analysis/blob/master/builds/readonlyREST.md) up and running. Jussi started work on Salt modules and troubleshooted missing log files. Saku got Kibana to use the authentication of readonlyREST and set up Nginx for proxy connection to Kibana. Eino tried to get tls connection with certs, without succeeding. On friday tried with openssl instead of gnutls cause it should give clearer error messages. Propably the installation was faulty, also lost report... Saku started looking into configuring Nginx |
|wk 45|26|16|14|Jussi created local repository for specific version of Elastic products + made it usable with Salt. Eino got tls encryption working with some dodgy file permissions. Saku started working on encrypting Nginx: used self-signed certs because the lack of dns-server. |
|wk 46|25|10|13|Made v1.0 of Salt packages. Ready for outside user testing. First beta tests done on the Server Management course by students, some issues and bugs fixed. Improved and cleaned salt README structure, Added SSL and HTTP authentication to Salt packages. SSL authentication for Nginx completed without security warnings!|
|wk 47|12|11|11|Automated OpenSSL certificate generation and integrated it into the server setup script. Continued work on creating dashboards. Added firewall rules as a salt module.|
|wk 48|13|13|13|Improved firewall module, started work on RELP encoding for Rsyslog. Looking for a way to forward all log data in /var/log/ to log-server in in same format as on client(s), using wildcard in imfile module|
|wk 49|9|9|9|Worked on alternative message sorting, and recursive log forwarding for all log files from a client. RELP encoding is now functional, certificate generation and serving is automated via setup script & salt states.|
